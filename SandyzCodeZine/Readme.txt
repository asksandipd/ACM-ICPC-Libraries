 - Confessions from the heart of a wunderkind
#***********************************#

I 've finally decided to share the libs, sidelining with the open source paradigm, which is more or less like shedding the C-plus plus attire and moving onto newer trails like Ruby and IronPython - the scripty - webby side of the network...

I hereby declare my code base public hoping it would help and interest any curious teenage CS wannabe "spiderman" and at the same time, claim that, not all of the code in this archive which I used till date at my university coaching tutorial sessions, programming contests, solely authored by me. That said, whether this declaration, renders the beauty of the code irrelevant remains to ge judged and then accepted. But either way, I still think maintaining  such a code base is worth having. 

Acknowledgements:
============================================================
My sincere thanks and regards to all the red, blue, yellow, green topcoders who have helped me patiently through the ups and downs of a very intriguing and intrepid problem solving and coding journey altogether since dawn of circa. 2003. 


Notes in Retrospect:
============================================================
1. The code here was an incredibly useful companion to me, and I thought off incinerating the files off my hard drive, rather than maintaining, annotating, checking in, version-file-naming them.

2. Now that I am into Git, I will try to ensure, no spam litters here and there, comments and suggestions are welcome!

3. I was always fascinated by the green terminal and in general by the build messages flashing now and then on the scrolling xterms. But when it comes to writing porgramming solutions in a contest setting, i prefer Lindows, cygwin and the like.
